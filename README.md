# Cybersecurity Strategy for Blue Bottle Coffee

## Overview

The cybersecurity strategy for Blue Bottle Coffee is structured around a strategic framework aligned with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) guidelines. It emphasizes strengthening the organization's defenses against cyber threats and ensuring the protection of sensitive data through the integration of advanced AWS security services.

## Security Architecture Description

### Web Traffic Security

- **AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall)**: Filters incoming web traffic to ward off common web exploits.
- **AWS Shield**: Provides DDoS protection to maintain availability and performance.

### Content Delivery and Management

- **AWS CloudFront**: A global Content Delivery Network (CDN) service that securely delivers data to customers with low latency and high transfer speeds.
- **EC2 Instances**: Host the Blue Bottle Coffee platform, managing web services and applications.
- **IAM (Identity and Access Management)**: Manages user roles, providing secure access to AWS services.

### Network Protection and Isolation

- **VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)**: Ensures network isolation, creating a secure virtual network for resources.

### Data Security and Access Control

- **Amazon S3**: Utilizes Access Control Lists (ACLs) to control access to data stored in S3 buckets.
- **AWS Secrets Manager**: Manages secrets needed to access applications, services, and IT resources securely.
- **AWS KMS (Key Management Service)**: Secures data-at-rest by managing cryptographic keys.

### Monitoring and Incident Response

- **AWS CloudTrail**: Logs API activity within the AWS infrastructure for auditing and historical review.
- **AWS GuardDuty**: Provides intelligent threat detection that continuously monitors for malicious and unauthorized behavior.
- **AWS Config**: Evaluates AWS resource configurations for compliance auditing and security analysis.
- **AWS Inspector**: Automatically assesses applications for vulnerabilities or deviations from best practices.
- **AWS CloudWatch**: Monitors logs and events, enabling operational visibility into AWS resources.

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Planning and Design

- Review and align with NIST cybersecurity framework guidelines.
- Evaluate existing security posture and identify critical assets and data requiring protection.

### Phase 2: Security Services Integration

- Set up and configure AWS WAF and AWS Shield for frontline defense against web attacks.
- Implement IAM policies and roles to manage access permissions securely.
- Design and configure a VPC with appropriate subnets and network access controls for resource isolation.

### Phase 3: Data Protection

- Configure S3 buckets with ACLs to control data access.
- Utilize AWS Secrets Manager and KMS for managing sensitive information and encryption keys.

### Phase 4: Monitoring and Incident Response

- Deploy AWS CloudTrail and GuardDuty for continuous security monitoring and threat detection.
- Configure AWS Config and Inspector for compliance monitoring and vulnerability assessments.
- Utilize AWS CloudWatch for log and event management to ensure operational awareness.

### Phase 5: Continuous Improvement

- Regularly review security measures against NIST guidelines and update as necessary.
- Conduct periodic security assessments and audits to identify potential improvements.

## Maintenance and Review

- Maintain a regular review schedule to ensure security measures are current and effective.
- Analyze monitoring data and logs to proactively detect and respond to potential security issues.

## Incident Response

- Establish an incident response team equipped with the necessary tools and access to AWS services.
- Develop incident response plans that outline procedures for different types of security incidents.

## Conclusion

The cybersecurity strategy developed for Blue Bottle Coffee reflects a comprehensive and adaptive approach to defending against cyber threats. By leveraging AWS's advanced security services, we've established robust access control, data protection, and a strategic incident response mechanism that collectively enhance the cybersecurity posture of the company in accordance with NIST guidelines.
